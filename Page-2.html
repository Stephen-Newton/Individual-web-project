            <h4>During my time here at Ksu I have learned a lot and I have come a great way. 
                I first started to learn about computers in high school. I grew up here in Georgia
                and more specificaly Atlanta. I went to Fry elementary then Durham middle school
                and then I went to Allatoona high school. I took classess their about
                programing and even web delvopment so I got a pretty good foundation formed 
                so I could do better latter on.

                I am currently 21 years old and have lived in Atlanta my whole life. I have had
                nemerous intrest growing up but my prefered pass time ir reading. I love to read
                I always have a book on me in some capasity and I'm a very fast reader to, in fact
                I once read the first Harry Potter book in a single day. Some of my other hobbies 
                include building Legos, playing video games, and learnig about mythology.

            <h4>Here at KSU I've taken a number of classess about programing and devlopment 
                and I have studyied all the major programing languages to some extent. I 
                have been studing to enter the feild of computer science and cyber security
                while I have been here. I have been planing to enter the feild of cyber security and have studyied 
                for it. I will probably need to study a bit more then before I go into anything
                serious. I can't say where the future will take me but I'm exicted and happy to
                meet it head on with the lessons I have learned making the way.
